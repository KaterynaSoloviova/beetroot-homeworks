# Task 1
# School
# Make a class structure in python representing people at school. Make a base class called Person, a class called
# Student, and another one called Teacher. Try to find as many methods and attributes as you can which belong to
# different classes, and keep in mind which are common and which are not. For example, the name should be a Person
# attribute, while salary should only be available to the teacher.
